# Bee_app

Beside honeybee, many solitary bee species numbers are dwindling in the wild. It is hoped this app can assist in identifying bee species for tracking.

Streamlit bee classification app https://c123ian-bee-app-app-evtngf.streamlitapp.com/, trained on 295903 images of 99 bee species sourced from https://species.biodiversityireland.ie/.
